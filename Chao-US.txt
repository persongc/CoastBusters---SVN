1. As a hiker, I want to search for hiking trails by bike accessibility,
so that I can ride my bike on hiking trails.

2. As a beginner hiker, I want to find short and easy hiking trails, so that
I can build up to more difficult hikes later on.

3. As a hiker with a busy schedule, I want to search for hiking trails by
operational hours, so that I can find a hiking trail that is open and fits
my schedule.
