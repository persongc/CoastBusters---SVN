1. As a resident of PCV, I want to know which hikes are within walking distance
of me, so that I can reach them without a car.

2. As an out-of-shape person, I want to know what hikes aren't challenging, so
I can enjoy myself without struggling to complete the trail.

3. As a user, I want to know if the weather will interfere with a hike, so I
can decide whether or not to hike a specifc trail.
